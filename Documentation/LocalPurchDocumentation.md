# Local-Purch Website Documentation

**This final project is centered around our concept of an e-commerce website we call Local-Purch. The documentation will go over our project, the problems we're looking to solve, our solutions, and the inspiration behind our project, carried out by PIW. The live demo for our project can be viewed here: https://local-purch.netlify.app**

**PIW consists of Prigorian Alifa Pahsya (2602186011), Mohammad Izam Ghali (2602181780), and Wilhelm David Travers (2602180494).**

# **Let's talk more about everything:**

**E-commerce has developed exponentially since the internet was a thing. Pushed back by the pandemic, everyone sought for an alternative income through selling goods and services. Unfortunately, not everyone can sell and distribute to rural areas due to the expensive costs in doing so, and unfortunately, not all areas in Indonesia have signal. With all this in mind, we hope to bridge this gap.**

**We came up with the idea for an e-commerce website to make life easier for people that live far from the city or rural area, an idea that we sell needs and many secondary goods for a convincing minimum delivery price for people to fulfill their needs. Our inspiration behind this project is Amazon and Tokopedia.**

Through accessing the link to our live demo, you'll be greeted with the Home page. This page displays discounts, promotions, and the most sold products (labeled as "Hot Deals"), not tied to a specific category of goods and services, including basic product information such as product name and price (as well as the amount of items in your shopping cart).

The Home page consists of other functionalities as well, buttons within the website's header that refer to the Browse, About Us, and News pages, the search bar will allow users to search for specific goods and services on our website, and users will also be able to log into their account (or sign up for an account on our website if they do not have one yet) to process orders and sell, among other things.

*Here are pictures of the Home page on Local-Purch:*

Items are sorted into various categories: Electronics, Automotive, and Home & Kitchen. This is made apparent by hovering your mouse over the Browse button as seen below:

For users looking to get more information on products sold on our website, they can click "Learn more", they can then view the full product page for the product they'd like to learn more about. A full product page contains information such as the product name, price, description, and allows users to customize the product they'd like to purchase (in whatever way is possible, this often includes things like the product's color and storage). Currently, users can purchase more than 1 of the same product at once, however, they're limited to 5 at a time.

*Here is a picture of the iPhone 14's product page on Local-Purch:*

Users will be able to add items they like to their cart and proceed to checkout whenever they want to. The numbers accompanying the shopping cart reflect on the amount of items pending for purchase.

*Here is a picture of the popup showing when an item is added to your cart on Local-Purch:*

Through accessing the Login page, you'll be able to log into your already-existing account by entering your email address and password (or through alternative methods using your Google, Facebook, or Apple account). Users that have forgotten their password will be able to request an email to reset their password. See below:

For users looking to know more about us, our platform/website, and our values, they can visit our About Us page. Currently, this page only displays the values "Secured Transaction", "Customer Satisfaction", and "Extended Distribution" with placeholder text under each of them. See below:

This documentation only reflects on the current state of the platform and website. While there are buttons within the website's header and footer, not all of them serve functionality and only the ones fully documented here do.
